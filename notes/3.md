# Why GraphQL?

GraphQL allows us to use any client we want (web, mobile, server) and connect to our server that's using any language or any type of database. GraphQL just sits in the middle between our client and our database or server.

1. GraphQL is fast.

In a traditional application, we might make a request to `/posts/1123` to get a specific post and then another request to `/posts?author=12` to get the data about who made the post and then finally we would make a third request to `/posts/123/comments/` to fetch all the comments on the post we're displaying.

Contrasting the above methods, we can use GraphQL to perform a single request that will fetch data for the post, the author, and the comments all in one request.

2. GraphQL is flexible.

With GraphQL, it is the individual client that determines what data it gets back from the server.
With a REST API, it is the server that determines what data gets sent back to what endpoint.

3. GraphQL is easy to use and simple to maintain.

In a REST API, if we wanted different data from a specific endpoint, we would have to restructure things on our server and that would change or break any old requests that rely on that endpoint. With GraphQL, we can just change our query if we want to fetch different data.

Summary: GraphQL creates fast and flexible APIs, giving clients complete control to ask for just the data they need. Fewer HTTP requests. Flexible data querying. Less code to manage.
