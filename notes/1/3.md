# Why GraphQL?

GraphQL allows us to use any client we want (web, mobile, server) and connect to our server that's using any language or any type of database. GraphQL just sits in the middle between our client and our database or server.

1. GraphQL is fast.

In a traditional application, we might make a request to `/posts/1123` to get a specific post and then another request to `/posts?author=12` to get the data about who made the post and then finally we would make a third request to `/posts/123/comments/` to fetch all the comments on the post we're displaying.

Contrasting the above methods, we can use GraphQL to perform a single request that will fetch data for the post, the author, and the comments all in one request.

2. GraphQL is flexible.

With GraphQL we can choose which types of data we want to fetch.......

3. GraphQL is easy to use and simple to maintain.
