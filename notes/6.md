# What is a Graph?

In this application, there are 3 main things that we are going to be storing.

1. Users
2. Posts
3. Comments

In GraphQL, these are known as types and types are things that we define when creating our GraphQL APIs.

When we define the types that make up our applications, we also define the field associated with each type.

Type: User

- Field: id
- Field: name
- Field: age

Type: Post

- Field: id
- Field: title
- Field: body
- Field: published

Type: Comment

- Field: id
- Field: text ("Thanks for the post!")

GraphQL doesn't care what type of database / server you are using behind the scenes.

We can also have data associations.
A User can have 0 or more posts, and each post belongs to a User.
A Post can have many comments, and a comment is associated with a Post.
A User can have many comments, and each comment is associated with a User.
