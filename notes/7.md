# GraphQL Queries

There are 3 different types of GraphQL operations we can perform.

1. Query (Allows us to fetch data)
2. Mutation (Allows us to change data)
3. Subscription (Allows us to watch data for changes)

All GraphQL APIs are self documenting. Our request dictates our response.

Our GraphQL API exposes a Schema, which describes all of the operations that could be performed. In the case of the `query` operation, it describes all of the fields you're allowed to select. That's why we can tell whether a field is invalid before we even send off a request.

If we look into our Schema, we can see that we have `hello: String!`. The exclamation point at the end indicates that we are always going to get a `String` back and we won't be getting `null` back.
